ProjEulerLib
============

A small library of helpers and extensions methods for solving problems on projecteuler.net

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is 'a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve'

I'm mostly using C# on LINQPad to solve the problems. I started writing this library to avoid writing again and again some boilerplate code. Be warned ! I'm being very pragmatic and the code can sometimes get ugly. Performances will most of the time be subpar to say the least. I'm trying to stay simple and not to overengineer things. As the problems grow more difficult and bruteforcing becomes no longer an option, I'll refine the algorithms.
